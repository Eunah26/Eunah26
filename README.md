👋 Hi, I'm Eunah!
I'm a second-year Computer Science and Networking Security student studying in Mauritius under the Mauritius–Africa Bilateral Scholarship, originally from South Africa 🇿🇦.

My journey into tech has been anything but linear — I initially pursued Chartered Accounting at the University of Cape Town before realizing that my true strengths and curiosity align more with problem-solving, logic, and digital innovation. Transitioning into computer science has been a deeply fulfilling and empowering decision.

🔐 I'm particularly drawn to fields like **Cryptography**, **Blockchain**, and **Artificial Intelligence** — areas I’m actively learning more about and building a foundation in through coursework, passion projects, and collaborative learning.

💡 My academic experience, leadership roles, and involvement in community tech events have shaped my drive to use technology as a tool for impact and inclusion. I'm currently looking for opportunities to gain real-world experience through internships in software development, tech support, and emerging tech sectors.
